Coffee Bringer
======

I together with some friends in school created this app to solve a major problem of ours. Every day we asked ourselfs, who is going to get coffee and who is waiting in the room watching over our computers? We solved this problem by creating an application which gave us the possibility to play Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide. 

The app was created as a part of the project iOS Developement at Jönköping University during late 2016. 
Course assignment documents can be found in folder: Assignment.

In Assignment 2 there is a link to our presentation. That presentation also includes the MockUp design of the app.
